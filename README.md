Expense Tracker (DSA-Based)
This project is a simple Expense Tracker built using fundamental Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA). It helps users to add, delete, search, and analyze expenses efficiently, showcasing practical DSA implementations in a real-world application.

Features
Add Expenses: Add new expenses with description, amount, and date.

Delete Expenses: Remove expenses using unique identifiers or filters.

Search Expenses: Find expenses by date, category, or description using efficient search algorithms.

Sort & Filter: Sort expenses by amount/date using sorting algorithms (e.g., quicksort, mergesort).

Monthly Summary: View total spending, category-wise analysis, and trends.

DSA Concepts Used
Linked Lists: To store expenses dynamically and allow easy insertion/deletion.

Hash Maps: For quick lookup and categorization of expenses.

Stacks/Queues: (Optional) To manage undo/redo operations.

Sorting Algorithms: To sort expenses by amount or date.

Searching Algorithms: To quickly find relevant expense records.

Custom Data Structures: Built a custom ExpenseManager class to simulate real-world data handling.

Technologies Used
Language: Python
